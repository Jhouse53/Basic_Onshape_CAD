## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
This assingment made me build a adittional piece along side the Base

### Reflection
This assingment was pretty simple but I built it twice because I built one separately and then built one with the Base

## Fork

### Description
This is the Fork we are going to use to hole the Tire

### Reflection
This was pretty simple it was just a repeat of what I already knew

## Tire

### Description
The Tire is the thing that the wheel is holding all that you have to do to create it is create a trapiziod and then revolve it

### Reflection
This was simple as well but I did have a bit of a hard time getting the trapiziod to be symmetric
